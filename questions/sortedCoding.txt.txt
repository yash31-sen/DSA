Programming and Algorithms
--------------------------
✔️error vs exceptions :Errors are serious issues that typically reflect problems with the underlying system or environment in which a    
                program is running. They are generally beyond the control of the application and cannot be reasonably handled.
✔️composite numbers: a positive number that can be found by multiplying 2 +ve numbers other than one
