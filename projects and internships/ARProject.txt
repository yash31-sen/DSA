Augtour: Explore The India Through AR:
what is: It is an Augmented Reality based application that aims to provide information and 3 visuals of India's rich heritage and culture or monuments.
Basically this app has 2 views basic view and advanced view.
With basic view user can scan the monument and get information about it in the form of text and audio.
With advanced view user can move around the monuments with the controller like a player move in the game and get an immersive augmented reality experience.

1)Technology Used: Unity, Blender, C#, Firebase.
Unity: Unity is primarily a game engine use for creating 2d and 3d games or AR/VR application.
	It supports various toolkit and SDK's like Vuforia, ARToolkit, ARCore etc for various SDk's for VR (pre built or built it)
2)Blender: Blender is an open source platform to create or manipulate 3d models and 2d animations.
It supports a lot of 3d formats like obj, fbx, .blend.
We can also apply colors to models by using materials and textures setting.
3)Firebase: Firebase is platform developed by google for building and managing mobile and web applications.
Offers variety of tools such as real time database, authentication, cloud storage, analytics and more.
It's scalable, reliable, and has a lot of service in single place.
4)C#: C# is a modern, general-purpose programming language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks and objectives that span over a variety of professions. 
a) Authentication Script
To access ui elements from unity import : using UnityEngine.UI;
for using firebase import : using Firebase and using Firebase.Auth;
**to get the value of input field use 
string email=emailInputField.text;
string password=passwordInputField.text;
to signup with email and password use:
auth.SignInWithEmailAndPasswordAsyn (inside it use things like if success store the result in variable  else do so etc
then Firebaseuser=task.result;
public InputField emailInputField;
public InputField passwordInputField; // by doing this the field get showed in the unity to attach the GameObjects.

** to switch scene in unity use :
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
  public void SwitchScene(string sceneName)
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneName);
    }
then in the unity

b)Player Controller Script:
Create a player empty gameobject attach  characterController or playerController script to it, make main camera child of player gameobject
define fields in code like speed, mousesenstivity, rotaionX, rotationY, rotationZ
transform.rotate(0,rotationX,0)
and same for rotationY and rotationZ

1) My Role in the Project: Creating animation, integration and making unity application.
2) Challenges Faced During project: One of the main challenge in integration and managing proper lighting and positioning of model and to reduce the size of model
3) What is AR: Augmented Reality overlays the digital content onto the real world, enhancing what you see around.
eg: Pokemon go
4) VR: Virtual Reality places us in a completely virtual world, make use of VR headset(Oculus, Jio) etc.
eg: VR games etc.

Testing of application:
1)Unit: test individual components and functions of you c# script 
2)Integration Testing:Fireabse integration, AR integration
Non functional testing:AR performance
                       load time
                       security testing
                       device and environmetn testing
