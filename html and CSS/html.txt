element vs tags:
In HTML, an element is the fundamental building block and consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, <p>Hello World!</p> is a paragraph element.

A tag, on the other hand, is used to create an HTML element and can either be a start tag (<p>) or an end tag (</p>). Tags are the markers that define the beginning and end of an element.
