Java Server Page

<%>  <%> => data inside the serrive method  
<%!> <%> => data outside the service method // decleration tag
<$@page> import java.util.*; <%> will go to import section of the java class (if multiple packages the seperate them by comma(,)) itis directive tag

<%=> <%>// in out.println directly

Tags:
1)Scriplet Tag[<%----%>]: code part of service method, can have multiple scriplet tags
2)Decleration Tag[<%!----%>]: code outside the service tag
3)Directive  Tag[<%@page-----%>]: if we want to import a package and use some external tag 
Note: import like that:-> <%@page import ="java.util.*"%>
4)Expression Tag[<%=-----------%>]: used to directly acess variables, everything inside this tag becomes the part of out.println() in servlet 


________________
JSP directives: [@page, @include, @taglib]
if we want ot specify something for entire page we do it in directive tag eg: import tag, mention the page handles the excetion or not 

@page:
syntax:->           <%@page attribute="value" attribute="value" ...%>
language="Scripting language",
extends="classname",
import="importlist",
session="true/false",
autoFlush="true/false",
contentType="ctinfo",
errorPage="err_url",
isErrorPage="true/false",
info="inoration",
isElIgnored, isThreadSafe


@include: if we already have jsp page and want to include that in current jsp page use this tag
syntax: <% include file="filename" %>

@taglib: html has limited tags and if we want to use external tags then this tag is used

syntax: <@taglib uri="uri" prefix="fx" %>

=> builtin objects can be used in scriplet and Expression tags 

implicit objects in JSP:
req, res, PageContext (pageContext), out(JSpWriter) -pagewriter object, session (HttpSession), Application (SErvletContext), Config (HttpConfig)


to make attribute available to current page ise pageContext
we can make pagecontext available to session as well as:
pageContext.setAttribute("name", "somone");//current page only
pageContext.setAttribute("name", "somone",PageContext.SESSOIN_SCOPE);//sessopm scope only


Exception handling in jsp:
same as java exception use in scriplet tag
to set a page to error page we have to declare in a page like that:
<%@ page isErrorPage%>
and this on page where the exception may occure:
<@page errorPage="errorPage.jsp"%>


JDBC in JSP:





JSTL(JSP Standard Tag Liberary):











Servlet Filter:
Filters does not know other filters are working and which which filter data is comming from
-> if we have multiple filters and want to check for them we have to chain them and this is called fiulter chaining 

for whoch request to call which is filter is configured in web.xml file

methods of filters: 1)init(), 2)dofilter(ServletReq,ServletRes, filterChain), 3) //not httpservletrequest so need to typecast it
destroy()

to configure filter we use filter config

filteres are plugable
one filter is not dependent on otehr filter unlinke servlet where we have to mention that whoch next filter we have to call


Comments in JSP:
3 types:
1)HTML comments (sent to client)  [<!-->]
2)JSP comments (does not sent to client)  [<%--   --%>]
3)Java comments (single line and multiline, does not sent top client) [// , /**/]
