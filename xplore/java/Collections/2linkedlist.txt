like an arraylist it is also an implementational class of list, 
syntax:
LinkedList<Integer> llist=new LinkedList<>();
it is doubly linked list 

List<Integer> llist=new LinkedList<>(); //we can also create it like that but with it we won't be able to access all the methods of linked list, we can only access methods of list 


llist.add();
llist.get();
llist.addLast();
llist.addFirst();
llist.getFirst();
llist.getLast();
llist.removeAll(passotherlist);
llist.removeIf(x->x%2==0);

it can behave like an an vector,list as well it is very powerfull class, arraylist as well with some opearations
