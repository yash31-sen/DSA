Java Exceptions:
An Exceptions is an unexpected event that occures during the program execution. It affects teh flow of program instruction which can caouse the program to terminate abnormally.


Exceptions can occure due to so many reasons like:
1)Invalid user input
2)device failure
3)loss of network connection
4)physical limitaion 
5)code err
6)opening the fiule that does not exists


types:
1)runtime Exceptions=> occures due to programming erros
Note: if it is runtime exceptipn then it is your fault 
eg:
null pointer access(missing the initialization of variable)
null pointer
out of bound array index(ArrayIndexOutOfBound)
divide by 0(Arithmatic Exceptions)

2)JAVA IO Exceptions=>also called as checked Exceptions, they are checked during compile time 
eg:
trying to open afile that does not exists(FileNotFoundException)
trying to read past the end of file 


we can use finally after try as well without catch 
on err in code in try block it will first execute finally block and then give errr
finally can be used only once

=>there are some cases where finally block dies nit executes
)when you write system.exit() method
)an exxception occure in finally block
)the death of an thread



Throws=> when you want to tell others that perticular function may throw an error
eg:
static int add() throws ArithmaticException{
    
}


Throw keyword used to throw exceptipn explicitly.
with this keyword we can throw already existing exceptions as well as we can throw custom made exceptions
