Regression: statical process of extimating the relationship among variables
linear regression -> y=mx+c
logistic regresson-> y=1\[1+e^-(mx+b)]

When to use Logistic regression:
*target variable is binary *transparency is important 
* fairly well-behaved data

When to no use:
*continuos trget variable
*massive data(rows or columns)
unwidely data
performance is the  only thing that matters 

import logistic regression:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
LogisticRegression() # on runnig this we got many things inside the function LogisticRegression(-,-,-,-,-)these all are called as logistic regression

C hyperparameter -> a regularization parameter in logistic regression, controls how closely the model fits to the training data

C=1/lambda, lambda=0 -> low reg, high complexity, more likely to overfitt

to tune there hyperparameter we use gridsearch (also used for cross validation, Systematic search, performance matrix )

grid search has methods like fit etc

**How many individual Logistic Regression models were fit using GridSearchCV?->35
